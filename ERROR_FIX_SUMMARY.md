# ‚úÖ Error Fix Summary: "calculateImpactMetrics is not defined"

## üîç **Root Cause**
The error occurred because `calculateImpactMetrics` was defined **inside** the `ImpactDashboard` component but was being called **outside** of it in the main application component. This created a scope issue where the function wasn't accessible where it was needed.

## üõ†Ô∏è **Solution Implemented**

### **1. Moved Functions to Global Scope**
I moved the following functions from inside `ImpactDashboard` to the global scope (outside all components):

- `getPopulationData(lat, lng)` - Population estimation
- `calculateEconomicDamage()` - Enhanced economic damage calculation  
- `calculateImpactMetrics()` - Main metrics calculation

### **2. Updated Function Signatures**
Changed the function from:
```javascript
// OLD (inside component)
const calculateImpactMetrics = () => {
  // Used component's props directly
}
```

To:
```javascript
// NEW (global scope)
const calculateImpactMetrics = (impactResults, selectedPosition) => {
  // Parameters passed explicitly
}
```

### **3. Updated All Function Calls**
Fixed all references throughout the application:

**Before:**
```javascript
calculateImpactMetrics()?.economicBreakdown
```

**After:**
```javascript
calculateImpactMetrics(impactResults, selectedPosition)?.economicBreakdown
```

## üìç **Files Modified**
- `frontend/src/App.js` - Main application file with economic calculation functions

## ‚úÖ **What's Fixed**

1. **‚úÖ Runtime Error Resolved**: `calculateImpactMetrics is not defined` error eliminated
2. **‚úÖ Economic Breakdown Display**: Now shows detailed economic damage factors
3. **‚úÖ Function Scope**: All calculation functions properly accessible
4. **‚úÖ Parameter Passing**: Functions receive required data explicitly
5. **‚úÖ No Linter Errors**: Code passes all syntax checks

## üß™ **Testing Steps**

1. **Open the Application**
   - The app should now load without runtime errors
   - No red error overlay should appear

2. **Test Calculate Impact**
   - Select a location on the map
   - Click "Calculate Impact"
   - Should see economic damage results

3. **Verify Economic Breakdown**
   - Look for the "üí∞ Economic Damage Breakdown" section
   - Should display base damage, location factor, infrastructure factor, etc.
   - Each factor should show numerical values

4. **Test Different Locations**
   - Try rural vs urban locations
   - Economic damage should vary significantly based on location

## üéØ **Expected Behavior**

### **Rural Location (e.g., farmland)**
- Lower location multiplier (~1.0√ó)
- Lower infrastructure factor
- Economic damage: Moderate

### **Major City (e.g., NYC, San Francisco)**
- High location multiplier (12.0√ó - 16.0√ó)
- High infrastructure factor (3.0√ó)
- Economic damage: Very high

### **Developing Region**
- Medium location multiplier (2.0√ó - 4.0√ó)
- Variable infrastructure factor
- Economic damage: Moderate to high

## üîß **Technical Details**

The economic damage calculation now properly includes:
- **Base damage** from impact energy
- **Location factors** based on economic centers
- **Infrastructure density** from population
- **Area scaling** for network effects
- **Environmental multipliers** for climate impact

All functions are properly scoped and accessible throughout the application.

**The application should now work correctly without any runtime errors! üéâ**
